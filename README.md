# pytorchCNNs Purpose

I wanted to disply my ability to perform multi-classification with pytorch. In this process I define a bespoke CNN with *questionable performance* to display my ability to create and implement CNNs from scratch. I pride myself on my ability to pick up academic literature and implement the solutions. My repo on Positive-Unlabeled learning is similar in that I read a paper, found an implementation, and got it working. Data science is continually evolving and I don't want to be married to simple sci-kit learn implementations or out-of-the-box algorithms built-in to software. As such, I need to be able to implement others work.

I'm going to use the [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset. Top performing models such as ResNet9 have achieved an astonishing 92% accuracy. I will likely not get close to this as my model will be very, very simple in comparison. This is not novel work as that would require months of research and to consult with people that know AI Research better than I do; however, my model will run, make predictions, and be sound.
