# pytorchCNNs Purpose

I'm doing a walkthrough of CNNs for image classification via pytorch using a dataset from kaggle, the [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset.

I'm going to fit a few CNNs to this data and compare their performance. This is more about explaining *how* to do this as opposed to conducting a novel analysis or modeling approach. This dataset is from an old challenge and has been used heavily, but it's difficult to find many images without webscraping, which is beyond the purpose of this activity.
